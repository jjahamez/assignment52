🟪 Storage
🚀 Features
Persistent global state using React Context + Local Storage
User profile name saved across sessions (userName)
Favorites system persisted in browser storage
Custom useLocalStorage hook for reusable persistence logic
Map-based favorites system for fast lookup and toggling
Automatic sync between state and localStorage
Shared state across all routes and components
Header, views and modal all stay in sync across refreshes
Clean separation between UI state and persistence layer
🧠 Key Concepts
Persistent State with Local Storage Hook
The useLocalStorage hook abstracts browser persistence:

Reads initial value from localStorage
Falls back to default value if missing or invalid
Automatically serializes state updates back to storage
This makes state persistent without manual storage logic in components

Custom Hook Pattern: useLocalStorage
The hook combines:

useState for reactive UI updates
useEffect for persistence side effects
JSON serialization for safe storage
Key behavior:

Lazy initialization reads from storage once
Every update syncs automatically to localStorage
This allows any state to become persistent with one line of code

Context Layer with Persistent State
The UserProvider now uses useLocalStorage instead of useState, making global state persistent across sessions

It manages:

userName → stored under USERNAME_KEY
favoritesStorage → stored as serialized entries array
toggleFavorite → updates both Map + storage
This turns Context into a persistence-aware state container.

Favorites Stored as Serializable Entries
Since Map cannot be directly stored in localStorage, the system uses:

Array<[number, ImageCell]> for storage
new Map(favoritesStorage) for runtime usage
Flow:

Storage → Array of entries
Runtime → Map for fast access
Update → Map → Array → storage
This bridges performance + persistence

Toggle Logic with Persistence Sync
The toggleFavorite function:

Clones current Map
Adds or removes item
Converts Map → Array
Saves back to localStorage via hook
This ensures:

UI updates immediately
State persists after refresh
No duplicate entries
Map-Based Runtime Performance Layer
Even though storage uses arrays, runtime uses Map for:

O(1) lookup (has(image.id))
Fast toggle operations
Efficient rendering checks in UI
This keeps performance high while still being persistent

Hybrid State Architecture (Map + Array)
The system uses a dual-layer approach:

Storage layer:

JSON-safe array format
Runtime layer:

Map for efficient operations
This balances:

Browser limitations (JSON storage)
Performance requirements (Map access)
Global State Synchronization Across App
Because state lives in Context:

Header updates instantly with favorites count
Movie views reflect saved state
Favorites page rebuilds from Map
Settings updates persist after refresh
Everything stays in sync without extra logic

Component Transparency
Components remain unaware of persistence:

They consume Context normally
They do not interact with localStorage directly
Persistence is fully abstracted away
This keeps UI layer clean and reusable

Safe Persistence Initialization
The hook safely handles:

Missing keys in localStorage
Invalid JSON (try/catch fallback)
Type-safe return (T generic)
This prevents runtime crashes from corrupted storage

Separation of Concerns
Architecture is now split into:

Persistence layer:

useLocalStorage
State layer:

UserProvider
UI layer:

Views, Header, Components
This makes the system scalable and maintainable
